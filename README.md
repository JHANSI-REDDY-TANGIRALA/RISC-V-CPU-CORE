# RISC-V-CPU-CORE
Implemented a simple RISC-V CPU core using the Makerchip IDE in TL-Verilog. The core is capable of executing a simple test program that implements 31 core instructions of the base RISC-V instruction set (RV32I)

I learned to make this through an edx course offered by Steve Hoover. You can also find this course on github: https://github.com/stevehoover/LF-Building-a-RISC-V-CPU-Core-Course/blob/main/course.md
